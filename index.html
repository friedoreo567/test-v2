                Bach Dinh (French: <i> Villa Blanche </i>) is a European-styled villa built towards the end of 
                the 19th century, located near the Big Mountain of Vung Tau city. This place is used by the 
                Governor-General of French Indochina, King Bao Dai and Prime Ministers of South Vietnam. 
                From 1907 to 1916, this place was also used to imprison King Thanh Thai. In August 4th, 1992, 
                Bach Dinh was recognized as a historical heritage site.

            <p>
                In the place that is occupied by Bach Dinh today, King Minh Mang built a fortress, which was 
                flattened out by the French after their conquest. Governor Paul Doumer sanctioned building 
                a villa and named it Villa Blanche after his daughter, Blanche Richel Doumer. Construction 
                began in 1898 and finsihed in 1902. Vietnamese locals called this place Bach Dinh 
                (White Palace) because the exterior is painted white, and also because of its French name 
                ("blanche" is French for "white").

               Paul Doumer never got to stay in the villa he built. In fact, his successor, Paul Beau, was 
               the first to use Bach Dinh. This place was then used to imprison King Thanh Thai until 1916, 
               when he and his son, King Duy Tan, was exiled to Réunion Island. The Indochina Governors 
               used this place for leisure again until 1934, when Bach Dinh was transferred to King Bao Dai.

               In the following years, most senior officials of South Vietnam would spend their vacation 
               in Bach Dinh. After 1975, this place became a tourist attraction and was recognized as a 
               historical heritage in 1992.
