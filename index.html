                Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving the application of pain or 
                constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such 
                as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital 
                flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking. 
                The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or 
                emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing 
                to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.

                Bach Dinh (French: <i> Villa Blanche </i>) is a European-styled villa built towards the end of 
                the 19th century, located near the Big Mountain of Vung Tau city. This place is used by the 
                Governor-General of French Indochina, King Bao Dai and Prime Ministers of South Vietnam. 
                From 1907 to 1916, this place was also used to imprison King Thanh Thai. In August 4th, 1992, 
                Bach Dinh was recognized as a historical heritage site.

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                In the place that is occupied by Bach Dinh today, King Minh Mang built a fortress, which was 
                flattened out by the French after their conquest of Vietnam. Governor Paul Doumer sanctioned building 
                a villa and named it Villa Blanche after his daughter, Blanche Richel Doumer. Construction 
                began in 1898 and finsihed in 1902. Vietnamese locals called this place Bach Dinh 
                (White Palace) because the exterior is painted white, and also because of its French name 
                ("blanche" is French for "white").
            </p>
            <p>
               Paul Doumer never got to stay in the villa he built. In fact, his successor, Paul Beau, was 
               the first to use Bach Dinh. This place was then used to imprison King Thanh Thai until 1916, 
               when he and his son, King Duy Tan, was exiled to Réunion Island. The Indochina Governors 
               used this place for leisure again until 1934, when Bach Dinh was transferred to King Bao Dai.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the following years, most senior officials of South Vietnam would spend their vacation 
               in Bach Dinh. After 1975, this place became a tourist attraction and was recognized as a 
               historical heritage in 1992.

            Bach Dinh is surrounded by beautiful scenery overlooking the Front Beach, with two main paths 
            to it from the entrance gate: a walkway, and a road for vehicles (which I walked up regardless :D). 
            Both paths are between a row of trees which make for a very eye-catching sight.

                imprisonment of King Thanh Thai. Below are just some of them.

                The building is, obviously, not all there is to this site. There is also a staircase to an 
                observation tower, which overlooks the vast sea below. Cannons can also be seen once you 
                exit through the back of the main building. While these are just replicas, they do provide 
                a look into the military of the past.

                I don't know what to put here because <em> sometimes I genuinely wonder what the point of 
                doing all this is. Y'know, at face value there seems to be benefits such as "promoting 
                cultural value" and "preserving our heritage" which is the main reason why there are 
                campaigns to raise awareness in the first place. However, this practice has been shown, 
                time and time again, to not work, and even backfiring in some cases. Think about it 
                this way, have you ever have an advertisement that successfully manages to convince you 
                by obnoxiously shoving its ass into your face every day, every night, when you sleep and 
                when you masturbate? The answer is, of course, no! You would only think of it as annoying 
                and therefore stay further away from it! And whenever I do these "group projects", either 
                I do nothing and become the root of all problems, or I spend too much time nitpicking 
                every single small detail (because my OCD doesn't allow me to do otherwise) and waste 
                precious time that could be used in something else! And guess what happens when I 
                actually work? There will always be this one motherfucker who either doesn't work, arranges 
                to go to this sacred place that is super far away for no fucking reason, then go to the site 
                and take pictures of themselves instead of the artifacts that is integral to the website 
                design, and then promise to do the designing without actually doing it! In short, I think 
                doing these projects, if you can call it that, is a huge time-waster (literally every single 
                time I hear about "homework" it's always English, can you cut me some slack?) is unfair to 
                some members of the group, and is pretty useless. But what can I really do about this other 
                than painfully slaving away at it? Apparently making rants like this :) </em>
