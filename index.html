            Bach Dinh (English: <i> White Palace </i>, French: <i> Villa Blanche </i>) is a European-styled villa built towards the end of the 19th century, located near the Big Mountain of Vung Tau city. This place is used by the Governor-General of French Indochina, King Bao Dai and Prime Ministers of South Vietnam. From 1907 to 1916, this place was also used to imprison King Thanh Thai. In August 4th, 1992, Bach Dinh was recognized as a historical heritage site.
