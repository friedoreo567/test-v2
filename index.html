            Bach Dinh (French: <i> Villa Blanche </i>) is a European-styled villa built towards the end of the 19th century, located near the Big Mountain of Vung Tau city. This place is used by the Governor-General of French Indochina, King Bao Dai and Prime Ministers of South Vietnam. From 1907 to 1916, this place was also used to imprison King Thanh Thai. In August 4th, 1992, Bach Dinh was recognized as a historical heritage site.

            History
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the place that is occupied by Bach Dinh today, King Minh Mang built a fortress, which was flattened out by the French after their conquest. Governor Paul Doumer sanctioned building a villa and named it Villa Blanche after his daughter, Blanche Richel Doumer. Construction began in 1898 and finsihed in 1902. Vietnamese locals called this place Bach Dinh (White Palace) because the exterior is painted white, and also because of its French name ("blanche" is french for "white").
